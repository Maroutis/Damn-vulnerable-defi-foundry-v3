        // @note The tip that should make you ask questions is the fact that the execute() function which does external call does not follow Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern :  https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern. The check : 
        //  if (getOperationState(id) != OperationState.ReadyForExecution) {
        //     revert NotReadyForExecution(id);
        // }
        // is done after the external calls. 
        // So We should ask the question : can we send some external calls inside (re-entrancy) and outside the Timelock contract, reproduce the id and change it's state to ReadyForExecution so that the check afterwards would pass. The answer is yes !
        
        // To resolve this level, we need to drain the proxyVault contract. The only way to do this is to go through the Timelock contract since it is the owner of the proxy. So we can upgrade the implementation to some and execute a delegateCall that transfer funds from the context of the proxy. We can achieve this via the execute() function to execute external calls. 
        // The only issue is that in order to validate the last check, we have to execute the schedule function too.
        // And in order to call schedule() function we need that PROPOSER_ROLE assigned to us (or the attacking contract). This can be achieve via another low level call to the funcion grantRole of the AccessControl contract. So to summarize, we need to call execute() function that makes the following :
        // - Updates the implementation to a new one and delegateCall to it in order to drain the funds.
        // - Call updateDelay to make delay eq to 0 in order for this check else if (block.timestamp < op.readyAtTimestamp) { to not be true and have the execute check be valid. This will allow us to execute tx as soon as it is scheduled.
        // - Update the propose role and give it to the attacking contract that would be calling the function schedule()
        // - Call that attacking contract's function that does a low level call to schedule(). @note We have to use another contract to do a low level call to schedule because doing the schedule() directly inside the execute() will not be possible due to the fact that schedule() expects the exact same calldata as execute() (it would mean that we create a calldata for execute() that contains calldata for calling schedule and both of these are equal which is not possible obviously). We we need to do instead is having the attacking contract construct the calldata which is the same as the one we gave to execute() and that calldata will be used for calling schedule().
        // Enjoy !
